## Inflation affects daily life quality over time

When you go grocery shopping, do you feel that everything is increasing its price sneakily? What does \$20 in 2015 buy you compared to \$20 in 2022? Or there is no need to call back long-term memory, but don't you remember to buy something last year but price plus one to get the same product for this year? Inflation is an existing, unavoidable, and invisible thing reminding the decline of your purchasing power over time.

## What is inflation? How to measure it?

In economic terms, inflation is a term that significantly affects the economy of a country. It is a process of increasing the prices of goods and services over a specific period of time, as measured by a price index. One of the most commonly used price indices to measure inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The CPI compares the current month's prices with the previous month's prices, which are based on the base year in which the CPI is calculated.

The alternative measure of U.S. inflation is based on the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Nevertheless, China commonly uses a different indicator, the Producer Price Index (PPI), collected from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to reflect inflation.
